"""A library for retrieving free proxies (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5).

Basic usage:
    >>> import proxyscrape
    >>> collector = proxyscrape.create_collector('default', 'http')  # Create a collector for http resources
    >>> proxy = collector.get_proxy({'country': 'united states'})  # Retrieve a united states proxy

The main library components are:
    - Collector - responsible for scraping resources for proxies
    - Resource - a url + function combination for scraping proxies
    - Resource Type - a grouping of resources (i.e. http, https, socks4, socks5)

This exports:
    - add_resource(...) adds a new resource to be scraped
    - add_resource_type(...) adds a new resource type
    - create_collector(...) create a new collector to scrape resources
    - get_collector(...) retrieves a created collector
    - get_resource_type(...) retrieves all defined resource types
    - get_resources(...) retrieves all defined resources
